# LinguaAgents

Multi-agent AI language learning platform built with Next.js, LangChain.js, and OpenRouter.

Learn English, Spanish, or German through adaptive AI-powered conversation, grammar instruction, and assessment — all driven by specialized AI agents.

## Features (Phase 1 MVP)

- **Language Selection** — Choose between English, Spanish, and German
- **Placement Test** — AI-driven adaptive assessment to determine your CEFR level (A1-C2)
- **Free Conversation** — Chat naturally with an AI tutor that corrects mistakes in real-time
- **Grammar Routing** — Ask about grammar rules and the system automatically routes to the Grammar Agent
- **Inline Corrections** — Mistakes are highlighted with explanations inline
- **Progress Tracking** — XP, streak, and CEFR level tracked with localStorage persistence
- **Animated Avatars** — Language-specific tutor characters with expression states
- **Streaming Responses** — Real-time token streaming via Server-Sent Events

## Architecture

```
User → API Route → Orchestrator Agent → routes to:
  ├── Conversation Agent (free dialogue with corrections)
  ├── Grammar Agent (rules, exercises, error analysis)
  └── Assessment Agent (placement tests, quizzes)
```

Each agent uses LangChain.js with OpenRouter to access free LLM models:
- `mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct:free` — Conversation & Grammar
- `meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free` — Assessment & Curriculum

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add your OpenRouter API key to .env

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to start learning.

## Getting an OpenRouter API Key

1. Go to [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)
2. Create a free account
3. Generate an API key
4. Add it to your `.env` file as `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`

Free-tier models are used by default — no credit card required.
